Intitator
===

This is a repo containing source files for the Intitator, which is a fork of the Fedorator. The purpose of the device is for writing a live image of [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) onto a USB  flash drive.  It acts as a multimedia hub on openSUSE booths at conferences and open source events.

This is the version that was built during Hackweek 17.
